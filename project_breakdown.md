Project Breakdown for AnomalyAI
1. Project Overview

AnomalyAI is a machine learning-based anomaly detection system built with Python. It uses Flask to connect the backend (machine learning model) to the frontend. The goal is to identify anomalies or outliers in datasets that may represent unusual patterns or behaviors, useful in applications like fraud detection, network security, etc.
2. Project Phases & Timeline

The project can be broken down into several phases with key milestones to ensure timely completion by the end of April:
Phase 1: Project Setup & Research (Week 1)

    Set Up Development Environment:

        Set up version control (GitHub) and IDE(VsCode).

        Install necessary libraries and frameworks (Flask, scikit-learn, etc.).

    Research & Finalize Anomaly Detection Models:

        Decide on which anomaly detection algorithms to implement (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, KMeans, DBSCAN).

        Research how different models work and their suitability for your project.

Phase 2: Model Implementation & Training (Week 2-3)

    Model Selection and Training:

        Use scikit-learn for implementing anomaly detection algorithms.

        Choose and implement a model like Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or another algorithm that works well for anomaly detection.

        Train the model on a sample dataset and test performance.

    Dataset Collection and Preprocessing:

        Collect sample datasets (e.g., from Kaggle or generate synthetic data).

        Preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalization, feature engineering).

Phase 3: Flask Backend & API Development (Week 3)

    Flask Setup:

        Set up the Flask app to handle incoming requests from the frontend.

        Develop RESTful APIs for interacting with the machine learning model (e.g., /predict, /train).

    Integrate the Trained Model with Flask:

        Load the pre-trained model inside Flask and create routes for predictions.

        Develop the /predict endpoint that receives data and returns predictions.

    Test the API:

        Test the /predict and /train endpoints using tools like Postman or Curl.

        Ensure the model returns correct anomaly detection results.

Phase 4: Frontend Development (Week 4)

    Frontend Setup:

        Set up the frontend (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or a framework like React) to interact with the Flask backend.

        Develop a user interface that allows users to upload data, view results, and visualize anomalies.

    Integrate Frontend with Flask Backend:

        Use JavaScript or a frontend framework (React or Vue.js) to send data to the Flask backend.

        Display predictions and anomaly results on the frontend.

    Visualization:

        Use a charting library (e.g., Plotly or Matplotlib) to visualize the anomalies detected in the data, like plotting outliers on a graph.

Phase 5: Testing, Debugging, and Finalization (End of Week 4)

    Test the System:

        Perform end-to-end testing: from uploading data, training the model, to predicting and visualizing anomalies.

        Address any bugs or issues.

    Final Documentation:

        Write the final README, including instructions for installation, usage, and examples.

        Add any necessary comments in the codebase.

3. Key Frameworks & Libraries

To make sure you have all the necessary tools for building AnomalyAI, here’s a breakdown of the key frameworks and libraries to use:
Backend Framework

    Flask: Lightweight Python web framework to create APIs for handling requests and interacting with the machine learning model.

        Installation: pip install Flask

Machine Learning Libraries

    scikit-learn: A powerful library for building machine learning models, including anomaly detection algorithms.

        Key Models:

            IsolationForest: An effective model for anomaly detection in high-dimensional data.

            OneClassSVM: Another popular model for detecting outliers.

            KMeans: Can be used for clustering and detecting anomalies by analyzing the distance of points from the cluster center.

            DBSCAN: Density-based clustering for anomaly detection.

        Installation: pip install scikit-learn

    NumPy: Library for numerical computing, often used for handling large arrays and matrices.

        Installation: pip install numpy

    Pandas: Essential for data manipulation and preprocessing. You will use it to clean and preprocess data.

        Installation: pip install pandas

Frontend Development (Optional)

    HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Basic tools for building the frontend of your application.

    React (Optional): A popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces, especially for handling dynamic data.

        Installation: npx create-react-app anomalyai-frontend

    Charting Libraries:

        Plotly: A popular graphing library for creating interactive plots and visualizing anomalies.

        Matplotlib: A standard Python plotting library (useful for generating charts on the backend).

        Installation: pip install plotly matplotlib

Miscellaneous Libraries

    Joblib: Used for saving and loading machine learning models.

        Installation: pip install joblib

    Requests: Python library for sending HTTP requests, useful if your frontend is separate from the backend and communicates via APIs.

        Installation: pip install requests

    Flask-Cors: If your frontend and backend are running on different ports, use this to handle cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) issues.

        Installation: pip install flask-cors

4. Project Architecture & Structure

Here’s a simple breakdown of the architecture and file structure for your project:

5. Detailed Plan for Each Component
Backend (Flask API)

    Routes:

        /predict (POST): Accepts data, sends it to the machine learning model, and returns the prediction (anomaly or normal).

        /train (POST): Accepts a new dataset and retrains the model (optional).

    Model Handling:

        Load the trained model using joblib or pickle.

        Use scikit-learn models like IsolationForest for anomaly detection.

Frontend

    File Upload: Create a simple form that allows users to upload datasets (CSV files).

    Display Predictions: After receiving the prediction from the backend, show the result (e.g., "Anomaly Detected" or "Normal Data").

    Visualizations: Plot the dataset and highlight detected anomalies using Plotly or Matplotlib.

6. Testing & Evaluation

    Unit Testing: Write unit tests for the backend to ensure each route (e.g., /predict, /train) works correctly.

    Model Evaluation: Evaluate your model on different datasets to check its accuracy and ability to detect anomalies effectively.
